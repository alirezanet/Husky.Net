## Installation

```shell
# global installation
dotnet tool install --global Husky

# local installation
cd <Your project root directory>
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install Husky
```

_Note: With the local installation, you have to prefix the commands with `dotnet` e.g `dotnet husky`_

### Setup husky for your project

```shell
cd <Your project root directory>
husky install
```

### Add your first hook

```shell
husky add .husky/pre-commit "echo 'Husky is awesome!'"
git add .husky/pre-commit
```

### Make a commit

```shell
git commit -m "Keep calm and commit"
# `echo 'Husky is awesome!'` will run every time you commit
```

---

## Task runner

After installation, you must have `task-runner.json` file in your `.husky` directory that you can use to define your tasks.

you can run and test your tasks with `husky run` command.

to use tasks in your git hooks, you can use `husky run` command.

e.g.

```shell
husky add .husky/pre-commit "husky run"
```

## Glob patterns

Husky.Net supports the standard dotnet `FileSystemGlobbing` patterns for include or exclude task configurations. read more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/file-globbing#pattern-formats)

## Notes

- I've added two sample task to the `task-runner.json` file,
make sure to read the comments before removing them until we complete the documentation. **any help appreciated!**

- Consider all bellow 1.x versions as beta. ( we need a lot of tests before major release )

- Don't forget to give a ⭐ on [GitHub](https://github.com/alirezanet/husky.net)

- This library inspired and is a combination of [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) & [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) & VsCode Task runner!, for **DotNet**, so make sure to support them too!

## Known issues
- On Linux/Mac you can only use the full path for the task runner command e.g. `/bin/touch` instead of `touch`.
- CLI Colors disappears when executed from hooks.
- husky run `--name` and `--group` not working.
